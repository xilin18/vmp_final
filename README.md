## Play Game

When the game starts, items randomly fly toward the pizza. They include ingredients for pizza, like tomatoes and cheese, but also things that shouldn't be in the pizza, such as shoes, dirts, and glasses. Ingredients are in the "assets/in" folder, and things that shouldn't be in the pizza are in the "assets/no" folder.

### Scoring
If you get pizza ingredients, you get 40 points, and if you get something that's not an ingredient, you lose one life. 
Lives start with three, but if you lose
 all three, the game ends. 
If you get 400 points before you lose all your lives, the game ends with the final screen.

### Crash Effect
When I got something that isn't an ingredient for the pizza, I wanted to create a collision effect. So I tried collision effect with the class CrashEffect to create a collision sound with an angry consumer's image, but I failed...
